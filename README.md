# UART-Based-Menu-Driven-Utility-for-STM32-Microcontroller
 The goal of this project is to develop a menu-driven utility using the STM32 microcontroller. The system communicates with the user through UART and performs specific operations based on user input, such as continuous ADC data acquisition, interrupt handling, and exiting the interface.
